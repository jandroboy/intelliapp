        <p class="mb-4">If you agree that the Prospective Employer may obtain such background reports, please read the following and sign below:</p>
        
        <p class="mb-4">I authorize Aries Freight Group Inc. ("Prospective Employer") to access the FMCSA Pre-Employment Screening Program (PSP) system to seek information regarding my commercial driving safety record and information regarding my safety inspection history. I understand that I am authorizing the release of safety performance information including crash data from the previous five (5) years and inspection history from the previous three (3) years. I understand and acknowledge that this release of information may assist the Prospective Employer to make a determination regarding my suitability as an employee.</p>
        
        <p class="mb-4">I further understand that neither the Prospective Employer nor the FMCSA contractor supplying the crash and safety information has the capability to correct any safety data that appears to be incorrect. I understand I may challenge the accuracy of the data by submitting a request to https://dataqs.fmcsa.dot.gov. If I challenge crash or inspection information reported by a State, FMCSA cannot change or correct this data. I understand my request will be forwarded by the DataQs system to the appropriate State for adjudication.</p>
        
        <p class="mb-4">I understand that any crash or inspection in which I was involved will display on my PSP report. Since the PSP report does not report, or assign, or imply fault, I acknowledge it will include all CMV crashes where I was a driver or co-driver and where those crashes were reported to FMCSA, regardless of fault. Similarly, I understand all inspections, with or without violations, will appear on my PSP report, and State citations associated with FMCSR violations that have been adjudicated by a court of law will also appear, and remain, on my PSP report. I have read the above Disclosure Regarding Background Reports provided to me by Prospective Employer and I understand that if I sign this Disclosure and Authorization, Prospective Employer may obtain a report of my crash and inspection history. I hereby authorize Prospective Employer and its employees, authorized agents, and/or affiliates to obtain the information authorized above.</p>
